# AirConsole
AirConsole iOS Bindings for Xamarin

Xamarin C# wrapper for Objective C bindings for [Air Console](https://www.get-console.com/airconsole/).

This is pretty much all created by [Bill Fulton](http://www.get-console.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1020&p=1583) on the Get-Console forum.  All I did was update a few NSObjects and nunints.
