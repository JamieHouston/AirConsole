# AirConsole
AirConsole iOS Bindings for Xamarin

Xamarin C# wrapper for Objective C bindings for [Air Console](https://www.get-console.com/airconsole/).

This is pretty much all created by Bill Fulton and discussed in the forums at  [Get-Console](http://www.get-console.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1020&p=1583) and [Xamarin](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/37769/how-to-handle-byte-in-generated-code-airconsole).  All I did was update a few NSObjects and nunints.
